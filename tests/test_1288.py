# Example 1:
#
# Input: intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,3]]
# Output: 1

# 1 <= intervals.length <= 1000
# intervals[i].length == 2
# 0 <= li <= ri <= 105
# All the given intervals are unique.
